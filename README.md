# Team_zoom_coding_challenge - Training a model to compute french difficulty
*This is our way of resolving the coding challenge!*
## Summary
* Provided data
* First notebook : Project guidelines
* Second notebook : Different tokenizers
* Third notebook : Text classification using NTLK (natural language toolkit)

## Provided data
## First notebook : Project guidelines
On that part, we trained models using our raw data, without cleaning them
## Second notebook : Different tokenizers
On that notebook, we tried to tokenize mainly using the "re library" (regular expression)
## Third notebook : Text classification using NTLK (natural language toolkit)
On that last part, we decided to create a new DataFrame containing new features about the properties of the sentences
